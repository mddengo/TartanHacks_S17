## 4U is For You
4U is a personalized assistant that can plan your budget, tell you where to eat, and even give you reminders throughout the day (breakfast, lunch, etc).

## Personalize
Take a picture of yourself in the beginning, then tailor your profile to *you*.

## Budget
Mention “budget” and you can log the amount of money you’ve spent so far in the day.

## Eat
Say, “I want to eat _ ” and 4U will search for top-rated restaurants that have the food you want.
